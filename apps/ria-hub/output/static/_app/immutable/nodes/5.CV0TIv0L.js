To play, enter a five-letter English word. For
    example:</p> <div class="example svelte-7mkc3r"><span class="close svelte-7mkc3r">r</span> <span class="missing svelte-7mkc3r">i</span> <span class="close svelte-7mkc3r">t</span> <span class="missing svelte-7mkc3r">z</span> <span class="exact svelte-7mkc3r">y</span></div> <p class="svelte-7mkc3r">The <span class="exact svelte-7mkc3r">y</span> is in the right place.
    <span class="close svelte-7mkc3r">r</span>
    and
    <span class="close svelte-7mkc3r">t</span>
    are the right letters, but in the wrong place. The other letters are wrong, and
    can be discarded. Let&#39;s make another guess:</p> <div class="example svelte-7mkc3r"><span class="exact svelte-7mkc3r">p</span> <span class="exact svelte-7mkc3r">a</span> <span class="exact svelte-7mkc3r">r</span> <span class="exact svelte-7mkc3r">t</span> <span class="exact svelte-7mkc3r">y</span></div> <p>This time we guessed right! You have <strong>six</strong> guesses to get the
    word.</p> <p>Unlike the original Wordle, Sverdle runs on the server instead of in the
    browser, making it impossible to cheat. It uses <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> and
    cookies to submit data, meaning you can even play with JavaScript disabled!</p>`;return{c(){e=i("meta"),n=k(),s=i("div"),s.innerHTML=o,this.h()},l(t){const a=f("svelte-1gj0au3",document.head);e=p(a,"META",{name:!0,content:!0}),a.forEach(l),n=x(t),s=p(t,"DIV",{class:!0,"data-svelte-h":!0}),_(s)!=="svelte-1u8hj95"&&(s.innerHTML=o),this.h()},h(){document.title="How to play Sverdle",c(e,"name","description"),c(e,"content","How to play Sverdle"),c(s,"class","text-column")},m(t,a){w(document.head,e),m(t,n,a),m(t,s,a)},p:r,i:r,o:r,d(t){t&&(l(n),l(s)),l(e)}}}class E extends u{constructor(e){super(),g(this,e,null,b,v,{})}}export{E as component,M as universal};
